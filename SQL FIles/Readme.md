# SQL Joins
SQL lets you join multiple data from muliptle tables.


You have the tools to obtain data from a single table in whatever format you want it. But what if the data you want is spread across multiple tables?

That's where JOIN comes in! JOIN is incredibly important in practical SQL workflows. So let's get started.
 ## Types of joins 
 #### Inner join

In inner join it has common elements of both of the tables

### Left outer join - when the left side of table is complete and has common elemets of both the elements which is releveant to the left side is left outer join
